In this project, we used the Parkinson’s Disease dataset from the UCI repository to build models that classify patients as having Parkinson’s or not based on biomedical voice features. We started by preprocessing the data, splitting it into training and validation sets, and addressing class imbalance with SMOTE to synthetically oversample the minority class. We trained two models: a Random Forest classifier as a baseline and an XGBoost classifier with hyperparameter tuning via grid search to improve performance. Evaluation involved calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, along with confusion matrices for detailed insight. We also optimized the classification threshold for the XGBoost model using precision-recall curves to maximize the F1-score, which balances sensitivity and precision. This approach resulted in a highly accurate and balanced model that performs well in detecting Parkinson’s cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining data balancing, hyperparameter tuning, and threshold adjustment techniques.
